# Exploring BeanOutputParser for Java Object Creation

## Objective:
To achieve better results using the BeanOutputParser method for creating Java objects.

## Current Status:
I have created a project utilizing the BeanOutputParser method, but the results are inconsistent. To address this issue, I plan to explore several strategies to improve the consistency of the output. I have tried some of these methods and the 
the final result is definetely improved, I am expecting further improvements as i implement these methods.

## Strategies to Improve Consistency:

### 1. Crafting a Better Prompt

The first approach I will take is to refine the prompt used for generating the Java objects. A well-structured prompt can significantly impact the accuracy of the output. I will experiment with different prompt formats and content to identify the most effective one. This approach, while seemingly obvious, is the quickest and easiest way to achieve better results.

Another strategy Iâ€™ve tried is to modify the prompt by using words like "copy," "explicitly," and "exact text" instead of "parse." This subtle change can help produce more precise outputs, as it emphasizes the need for exact replication over interpretation.

This method may help reduce errors and improve the consistency of the output.


### 2. Refining the Prompt

Building on the previous method, this approach involves refining the instructions to improve the prompt further. I can feed the current prompt to a model like ChatGPT and instruct it to enhance it. The more articulate and detailed the prompt, the better the results. I have also tried iterating multiple times until I achieved the desired outcome.


### 3. Leveraging Premade Prompts from the Spring AI Ecosystem

Digging into the methods of Spring AI ecosystem you can find the system prompts with the instructions, along with their format and content,I have tried to provide them to ChatGPT to evaluate the outcomes. I used this as an expirement as I can kind of see how will the model respond to a Spring Ai application. 

### 4. Utilizing a Larger Model with Extended Context

Next, I have tried to use a larger model with a more extensive context. This approach may help the language model better understand the relationships between the different components of the Java object, leading to more consistent results. In my testing I didnt find any significant diffrence between GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

GPT-4o-mini seems to be the best choice as its suitable for most tasks. There is no reason to use the largest model if a small one gives almost the same outcome.


### 5. Breaking Down the Format into Smaller Pieces

The current format may be too complex to parse in one go, particularly since the Resume class has nested classes that require a large number of tokens in the context. To address this, I will break down the format into smaller, more manageable pieces, which may help improve the accuracy of the output.

While I have yet tried it, I will try to save the resume class with the data from the content of the resume, without the nested classes like work experience, projects, volunteer work etc. 
I will then save the core resume in the database and do another call to the llm for the nested classes which are a few but have less attributes inside.
And last I will link in the database the core resume with the nested classes in order to get the final full version of the resume. 


### 6. Utilizing @ApiModelProperty for Improved Attribute Identification

I have used the @ApiModelProperty annotation to provide examples for each attribute, which may help the language model better understand the correct data to input for each field. This approach is particularly important for attributes that may be ambiguous or difficult to understand, such as "description." By providing clear examples, I hope to improve the accuracy of the output and achieve more consistent results.

There is a chance that the model wont even see the annotation and its contents but nevertheless it was worth a try.
Further testing is needed.

## Next Steps:

* Implement each of the strategies outlined above
* Evaluate the effectiveness of each approach
* Refine and combine the most successful strategies to achieve consistent results

## Conclusion:
By exploring these different strategies, I aim to improve the consistency of the output generated by the BeanOutputParser method. Through careful experimentation and refinement, I am confident that I can achieve more accurate and reliable results, ultimately leading to more effective Java object creation.
