My professional journey started in the world of culinary arts, where I worked as a Chef in various hotels and restaurants. My career in this field is anchored by formal degrees in culinary and pastry arts, showcasing a passion for learning new things.

In a significant career shift fom February 2023, I started exploring the world of programming. Starting with the Helsinki Java MOOC, I not only completed the course but also earned a certification, signifying my commitment to this new field. My journey in tech didn't stop there, I've since mastered tools and frameworks like GitHub, Spring/Spring Boot, and SQL, demonstrating my adaptability and eagerness to learn. Currently, I am channeling my culinary background into the development of a food delivery application. 

I am enthusiastic about connecting with individuals who share a passion for technology or culinary arts. Whether it's for potential collaborations, sharing insights, or exploring new opportunities, I welcome all connections in my career journey.
